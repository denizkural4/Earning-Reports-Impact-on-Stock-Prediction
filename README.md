# Project Description 
## Evaluate the impact of quarterly earnings report on stock price movement
### Thee purpose of this project is to understand the impact of a companyâ€™s earning release on its stock returns. Intuition tells us that companies that exceed expectations should see positive impact on their share prices. To test this hypothesis, we first categorize stocks into three groups of relatively even size based on whether they beat, meet, or miss their earnings expectation. Second, we randomly sample stocks from each group and compute the average of the relative returns against an index (to drop market noise) for the dates surrounding the announcement day. Finally, we visualize the cumulative average of these returns for each group.
